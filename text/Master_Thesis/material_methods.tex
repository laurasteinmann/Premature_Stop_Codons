\chapter{Material}
In this chapter we will have a look at the necessary computing infrastructure and the code base that I developed for studying of the selection on loss-of-function variants. At the end of this chapter we will have a look at our used dataset.
\section{Computational Material and Resources}
In this section I will explain the computational material. We will start with the computing infrastructure we used for our analysis and continue with looking at the location and dependencies of our code base.
\subsection{Computing Infrastructure}
The whole analysis is calculated on the institutes own high-performance computer cluster. With access to a computer node with 80 cores and 512 GB RAM. Also not all analysis need the maximum capacity of this computer node especially working with the basic unfiltered dataset consums a lot of RAM. To recapitulate any analysis access to a high-performance computer node is therefore necessary.
