\chapter{Material}
In this chapter we will have a look at the necessary computing infrastructure and the code base that I developed for studying of the selection on loss-of-function variants. At the end of this chapter we will have a look at our used dataset.
\section{Computational Material and Resources}
In this section I will explain the computational material. We will start with the computing infrastructure we used for our analysis and continue with looking at the location and dependencies of our code base.
