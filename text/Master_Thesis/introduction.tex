\chapter{Introduction}
To survive in an ecosystem organisms need to adapt to the specific abiotic and biotic factors around them. This is particularly important for plants since they can not change their habitat during their lifespan. Adaptation can operate on different levels of the organisms from the adaptation of protein function to modifications in cell functions or whole tissue functions. But the underlying fundamental process that drives adaptation is the modification of the genetic material DNA.\\
Modifications on DNA level are called mutations and can be categorized in four different groups. A point mutation, which is the first group of mutations, is concerning just one single base pair. These changes the DNA sequence on one single point and therefore lead to changes of the transcribed mRNA. The second class of mutations are insertions. These insert a new sequence into the former DNA sequence and thus elongate it. These insertions can have a variety of length from one single bp to a few hundred bp and even longer sequences can be added.  The contrasting class of insertions are deletions, which lead to a reduction of base pairs in a variety of lengths in the former DNA strand. The last category of mutations are duplications. As implied by the name regions of the DNA get duplicated and inserted at a different position. The regions can be copied abnormally one or even more times.\\
These mutations are first of all just changes in the DNA but indirectly they impact all the resulting processes. The DNA first gets transcribed into mRNA. This process is not affected by the evolved mutations. But after the transcription the mRNA gets translated into proteins. In this step the impact of the mutations appear since a triplet codon gets translated into a specific amino acid, which can change due to the mutation in the DNA. The mutations can have different effects on the codons. The insertions or deletions lead mostly to a shift in the reading frame. But also point mutations can have different effects on the translated codon and therefore on the functionality of the resulting protein. As it was known that 23 amino acids exists and that the knowledge arises that a codon includes 3 bp the codons could get deciphered from \textcite{Nirenberg1965}. The gain of knowledge deciphering this genetic code showed that not one codon is directly linked to an amino acid rather that there are multiple codons that can initiate the same amino acid, which is showed in \autoref{fig:Codons} a). For the topic of point mutations we have three possible outcomes resulting after such mutation occur. The first outcome is a silent mutation, which is the less severe one and does not change the protein at all. Here a base paire changes but the translated codons provoke the same amino acid. An schematic representation of silent mutations can be found in \autoref{fig:Codons} b).
